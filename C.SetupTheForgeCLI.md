# Setting up the Forge CLI

## Install the Forge CLI

Install the Forge CLI using npm. Youâ€™ll install the CLI globally so that the commands can be run across your system.

1. Install the Forge CLI globally by running:

```
npm install -g @forge/cli
```

2. Verify that the CLI is installed correctly by running:

```
forge --version
```

You should see a version number reported in the terminal. If a version number is not shown then the installation failed. Repeat step 1 and look for errors reported in the terminal.

With the CLI installed, you can view the complete list of Forge commands by running `forge --help`.


## Create an Atlassian API token

The Forge CLI needs to use you Atlassian account credentials to perform operations. This means you need to create an API token as follows:

1. Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens.
2. Click Create API token.
3. Enter a label to describe your API token. For example, forge-api-token.
4. Click Create.
5. Click Copy to clipboard.
6. Don't close the dialog because you will lose access to the token.


## Log in with an Atlassian API token using keychain or libsecret

### macOS and Linux

On macOS, Forge uses the built in keychain tool. 

On Linux, you'll need to install [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret).

With the API token created and in your clipboard, do the following:

1. Start the process of logging into the Forge CLI by running:

```
forge login
```

2. You'll be asked whether to allow Forge to collect usage analytics data. Answering yes allows Atlassian to monitor and improve Forge's overall performance and reliability. You can also read [Atlassian's Privacy Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy).
3. Enter the email address associated with your Atlassian account.
4. Enter your Atlassian API token.

Once logged into the Forge CLI:

1. Close the dialog showing the API token.


### Windows

Where keychain and libsecret are not supported, you can use the environment variables `FORGE_EMAIL` and `FORGE_API_TOKEN` to store your credentials.

```
read FORGE_EMAIL
# Enter email
read -s FORGE_API_TOKEN
# Enter API token (will not be displayed)
export FORGE_EMAIL FORGE_API_TOKEN
```
